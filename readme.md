# WhatsApp UI
Automation using Python and Selenium WebDriver
. This script automates the process of sending messages to a contact or group on whatsapp web
by entering text in an input field, clicking send button and then closing the browser window after some time
interval (default is 5 seconds).
The user can also specify how many times they want this automation to run by setting up a loop that
runs for n number of iterations.
The default value for n is set as infinite which means it will keep running until stopped manually.
